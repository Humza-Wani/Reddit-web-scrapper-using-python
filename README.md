As we know in today’s world social media platforms such as Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Youtube, Tik-tok etc profoundly describe the people’s opinion and their virtual presence on the Internet as well as in the real world. Every opinion, text, tweet, post, message, news, image and video is publically available on these platforms which generates enormous amount of digital data. However in the data being  generally   raw, unstructured and of huge volume  in most of the cases, doesn’t undermine the Analytical Statistics which can be obtained after pre-processing and transforming the data  into correct and usable format for quality, testing, research, training etc as per the current objective.
This humongous data can be extremely useful in a plethora of scenarios as it provides the opportunity for Data Analytics in numerous diverse studies and research, creating the opportunity to understand insights regarding any topic of interest and extracting hidden treasures from the data which can be effectively used by data analysts/scientists for its specific purpose.
A similar case study is presented in this document which reflects a particular case from a social media platform (Reddit) (an online community forum for news aggregation, web content rating, and discussions) and provides  inferences regarding similarity on  search/News query text data which is extracted from this source and answers some of the questions asked in the study.
